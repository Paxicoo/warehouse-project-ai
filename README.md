# Warehouse Picking Optimization System

This project is being developed for an AI class, and aims to optimize the process of picking products in a warehouse using A* search and genetic algorithms. The system efficiently distributes product pickups among agents, minimizes the total traveled distance, and reduces the number of collisions between agents.

## Features

- Distributes product pickups among multiple agents
- Minimizes the total traveled distance by agents
- Reduces the number of collisions between agents
- Utilizes A* search algorithm for pathfinding
- Applies genetic algorithms to optimize the order of product pickups

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/Paxicoo/warehouse-project-ai.git`

2. Open the project in your preferred Python IDE (such as PyCharm).

3. Ensure that you have the required Python packages installed. If necessary, you can install the required packages using `pip`
